This repository is used to document my journey of **60 Days of DevOps** challenge. The reason for this documentation is to help others understand the stuff that are required for *DevOps*.

This journey will not cover all things about "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall. I have created 60 videos for 60 days. So if you don't understand the documentation, you can watch the videos also.

Let's write the DevOps definition here and then start the journey day by day. I hope you will enjoy this. Happy Learning!

# What is DevOps?

The word DevOps is a combination of the terms development and operations, meant to represent a collaborative or shared approach to the tasks performed by a company's application development and IT operations teams.

It is an ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

## How DevOps Works?

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
